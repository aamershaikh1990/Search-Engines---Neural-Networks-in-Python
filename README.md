How to build a basic search engine and use neural network learning in Python

- *searchengine.py*: This file contains code to create a basic crawler class and searcher class. The link information from the crawler is then stored in searchindex.db, which is used by the various scoring algorithms in the searcher class

- *nn.py*: This file implements a basic single hidden layer neural network for machine learning purposes, in determining which search results should be returned to the top based on what users have clicked on before. nn.db is the database that is used to hold all the neural network node weighting information.
